Introduction
------------

As this is a new project, lets start by building a database of pins in cvs format (excel) for each board with the data for 
each pin. The idea is simple to operate on a dataset per pin of the boards. There is a limited number of operations that can 
be performed on each pin. For example imagine we want to declare a digital output or digital input.. etc, whatever, just look 
at it as an operation we wish to perform, analog, PWM.. etc it doesn't matter.. An operation..

Declarations
------------

To declare a new dataset:
Start a row on column A0 with "newtable" without the quotes for non-programmers. You can even upload solidworks file of 
electric compontents. Guy's half the idea of programming is the organisation of data.
